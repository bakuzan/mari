# Mari

Help Mari escape the trolls!

# What?

Mari is a maze mini-game. 

The goal is to guide Mari through the maze to the goal(X) while avoiding the trolls(T).

Mari can push walls to make new passage ways or - if she finds the hammer(h) - can destroy walls completely.

# Why ?

I wanted to learn python and thought a [simple challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/4vrb8n/weekly_25_escape_the_trolls/) would be the best way to get started
